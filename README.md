# Nutrition Tracker Backend

This repo contains the code for the backend of my nutrition tracker project.

## Project Description

The Nutrition Tracker is an application aimed at helping users keep track of their daily food consumption, categorize meals by type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and monitor their nutritional intake. The backend manages the data between the frontend and the database helping with accurate tracking.

## Technology

For this project, Spring Boot and Maven were used for the backend and a PostgreSQL database was used to store all food items and relevant data. The backend utilizes a RESTful API with many endpoints, allowing the frontend to interact with the system. This helps users retrieve daily food logs and delete entries.
